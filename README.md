# Embedded PDF External Module for REDCap
This module allows you to embed PDFs in the middle of your form using
the action tag `@EMBEDDEDPDF`. This is useful for displaying PDFs that 
are needed for reviewing prior forms.

## Installation
* Download from GitHub at https://github.com/metrc/redcap-embedded-pdf and clone this repo into to your modules directory -OR-
download from the official REDCap Repository through the Control Center.
* Enable the module through the Control Panel
* Set the web path to your eDocs folder in the module configuration page

## Usage
I've tried to make this as easy as possible. Simply add the action tag
`@EMBEDDEDPDF=event_name:form_name:instance` to a **Descriptive Text** field and the module will do the rest.

*The PDF will be appended to the text in the field, so you can add headers that will be shown before the PDF.*

Where `event_name` is the name of the event or unique event ID (as assigned by REDCap), `form_name` is the name of the form, and `instance` is the instance number of the form.

For non-longitudinal projects, you can either omit the event name or pass `0` as the event name.

You can also use the selected smart variables in place of the instance number:
* `[first-instance]`
* `[last-instance]`
* `[current-instance]`
* `[previous-instance]`
* `[all-instances]` (same as passing no instance number or 0)

Example:  `@EMBEDDEDPDF=baseline:demographics:[current-instance]`

**NOTE:** If the form you are referencing is blank (contains no data), the module will not generate a PDF.
**IN ADDITION, the field will be completely hidden on the form.**

It interoperates with other action tags.
